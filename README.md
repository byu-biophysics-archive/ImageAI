            will be using PyTorch. One job at a time requesting up to 16GB on a GPU.
    * After about a day you should receive an email on your byu email saying that your request has been approved or denied.
      * If it is denied: ->let us know in the ImageAI channel on Zulip. Give the reasoning why.

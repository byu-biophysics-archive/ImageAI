# ImageSegmentation
This repo serves as a guide for the BYU Image Segmentation group. Below, papers and videos are listed to introduce the topic of Tomogram AI.

## Papers
[Isonet](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.17.452128v1.full) is a deep learning-based software package that iteratively reconstructs the missing-wedge information and increases signal-to-noise ratio, using the knowledge learned from raw tomograms. The software is stored [here](https://github.com/IsoNet-cryoET/IsoNet) on GitHub.

[This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096921261930005X?via%3Dihub) discusses a framework for discovoring new structures in tomograms.

## Books
[Here](https://www.cellstructureatlas.org/) is an online textbook by Grant Jenson on microbial cells guided by cutting-edge 3D electron microscopy.

## Videos
Here is a quick [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR7k19YBqiw) that introduces the idea of clustering and image segmentation. 8 minutes.<br>
Here is a 17 minute [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGojI9xcCfg) by Grant Sanderson in the MIT series. Working with images in Julia.<br>
TODO(add more videos)

## Holiday To Dos
* Read Min Xu paper, discuss on zulip (Gus, Braxton, ...)
* Make a "tree" of tomogram AI literature (Gus, Braxton)
* Play with Braxtons CNN (all)
* Work on tutorial for NN and MLP (Gus)
* Update github repo (Braxton)
* Update anki with new stuff (Gus)

# Notes about TM

2 programs to note:

[pytom-match-pick](https://github.com/SBC-Utrecht/pytom-match-pick) and [warp](https://github.com/warpem/warp/)

[Wiki](https://github.com/SBC-Utrecht/pytom-match-pick/wiki) and [tutorial](https://github.com/SBC-Utrecht/pytom-match-pick/wiki/Tutorial) for pytom match

Warp is newer and is still being updated as we speak, it likely has more bugs, but it means we can probably be of help to them.

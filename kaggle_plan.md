## What Data Should We Give?
- 3D Tomograms
  - How many slices of tomograms will be provided?
  - Should we segment or shrink at all in the x or y dimensions?
  - How much total data (in GB) will be provided?
  - What file format should we use? (e.g., Numpy arrays, HDF5, etc.)
  - Should we preprocess any of the data (e.g., normalization, noise reduction)?
  - How should we handle missing data or artifacts?
  - Will we provide metadata (e.g., imaging parameters)?

## Data Collection and Preparation

- Who is Responsible for Data Collection and Preparation?
- Who will create the dataset?
- How will we ensure data quality and consistency?
- Will we need to anonymize or obfuscate any data?

## Scoring Metric

- Who Will Develop the Initial Scoring Metric?
- How will the scoring metric be determined? (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.)
- How will the metric handle imbalanced data?
- Who will validate and test the scoring metric?

## Documentation and Explanation

- Who Will Fill in Important Information Regarding Data, Problem, and Metric?
- Who will write detailed documentation about the dataset?
- How will we explain the problem statement and goals clearly?
- Who will provide a comprehensive explanation of the scoring metric?

## Platform and Logistics
- What needs to go through Kaggle? Do we make our own page?

## Getting Started Resources

- Who Will Write the Getting Started Notebook?
- Who will create a tutorial notebook for participants?
- What should the notebook cover? (e.g., data visualization, preprocessing, and model training)
- Should we include a baseline model (e.g., YOLO for detection)?
- How will we ensure the notebook is easy to understand and follow?

## Additional Considerations

### Competition Rules and Guidelines
What are the competition rules and guidelines?
How will we handle submissions and evaluate them?
What is the timeline for the competition?

### Team Formation and Collaboration
Will team participation be allowed?
How will we facilitate team formation and collaboration?

### Prize Structure and Incentives
What prizes will be offered to winners?
How will we structure incentives to encourage participation?

### Community Engagement and Support
How will we engage with the community and provide support?
Will there be forums or Q&A sessions?

Post-Competition Plans
What will happen to the data and models after the competition?
Will there be follow-up projects or publications based on the competition results?
